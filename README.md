# Social Media API

API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, also used Moment, a JavaScript date library, to format timestamps.
